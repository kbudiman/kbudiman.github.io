<p>Where My Noms At was a project done in my Software Engineering course. This project allowed me to experiment and learn web development. I was solely responsible for implementing the Google Maps API onto this website. The project also gave me the chance to familiarize myself with Model-View-Controller frameworks. We used PHP Laravel for our project's framework.</p>
