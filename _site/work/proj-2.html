<p>Part of the Cognitive Testing on the Computer battery of tests, the goal of this CTOC subtest was to assess the arithmetic abilities of seniors and evaluate the length of time to solve the equations. I used jQuery to access each DOM elements and assign functionalities for the UI in this task (eg. the buttons, images, etc). Scoring for this test is based on whether user answered each equation.</p>
