<h5>Qualitative Research</h5>
I tried to address some of the misconceptions that were found around the topic of Minimally Conscious State and Neuroimaging. To achieve this, I <b>transcribed expert interviews</b> and conducted <b>literature reviews</b> to communicate key scientific concepts for the public. 
<br />
<br />
Through the use of <b>thematic analysis and coding</b>, I identified main themes that were found in the media's portrayal of this topic. By applying <b>knowledge translation</b>, I validated these themes with findings from scientific journals and composed articles that properly described the topic. Knowledge translation allowed me to write these articles in a language more suitable for the public, while still maintaining the validity backed by scientific journals.
