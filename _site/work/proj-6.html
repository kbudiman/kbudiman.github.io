<h5>Brief</h5>
<p>
	In our Software Engineering course, we were required to build a website that parsed data from one of Vancouver's open data set. Our team decided to use the GPS locations of food trucks around Vancouver's Lower Mainland.
</p>

<h5>Implementation - <i>Google Maps</i></h5>
<p>
	I always had a fascination of geography and maps, so I took this opportunity to learn how to integrate the Google Maps API into our website. I embedded a Google map into our site by using JavaScript.

	<br />
	By taking the longitude and latitude of the food truck (that were provided in the data set), the API also allowed me to mark the locations of the truck with hotspot icons.

	<br />
	One of my team members constructed a list of food trucks on the right hand side of the map. I ensured that the map indicates the correct food truck when the user clicked on a food truck name from the list.

<h5>Implementation - <i>Google Maps Search</i></h5>
<p>
	I have also implemented SQL search queries to identify the appropriate food trucks when the user utilized our search box. Users can search by the truck's name, address, and other nearby trucks from that address (within 5km).

<h5>Implementation - <i>Model View Controller (MVC)</i></h5>
<p>
	One of the most challenging feat of this project was when I tried to setup the website using an MVC framework. After discussions with our teaching assistants, we decided to implement Laravel's MVC framework in PHP. I have never used PHP. However, after watching YouTube tutorials and reading online documentations, I was able to setup the members login and registration pages for our website.
</p>

<h5>Delivery</h5>
<p>
	We demonstrated our website in our final class day in front of our classmates and we received an 'A' for this project.
