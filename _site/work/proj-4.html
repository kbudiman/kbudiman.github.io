<h5>CHALLENGE</h5>
<p>Brook.org.uk was going through an online transition. Joining this transition, I decided to analyze their current ecommerce platform to provide recommendations that allow users to purchase resources from the site.

<h5>MY ROLE</h5>
<p>
	I acted as a user researcher and UI designer in this project.
</p>

<h5>APPROACH</h5>
<h2>i. Establishing Requirements</h2>
<p>
	I tried to dig deeper to find out who are the users of Brook’s shop by speaking with Brook’s digital platform representative. From this discussion, I was informed that these users consist of health professionals who are seeking to obtain educational resources for their school or clinic. I created the following persona to capture these users:

	<br />
</p>

<h2><i>Heuristic Evaluation</i></h2>
<p>
	To get a better idea of how the ecommerce was laid out, I partnered with two other UX researchers and conducted an expert Nielsen’s heuristic evaluation. This evaluation allowed me to identify several usability problems that may hinder from using the shop. In one issue, the search functionality did not return any products that cover the topic of alcohol (which do exist) even though the key word ‘drinking’ was searched.

<br />

<h2><i>User Evaluation</i></h2>
<p>
	Although heuristic evaluation identified a breadth of usability problems with the ecommerce platform, I wanted to confirm which issue would hinder users from successfully purchasing their desired products. To assess this, I recruited and directed user studies with 3 users (2 nursing students and 1 medical student). I gathered their feedback and prioritized two painpoints that were blocking their shopping experience:
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>Painpoint #1 – Search functionality is broken with no available means of recovery for users
	</b>
	<br />
	All users were frustrated since some keywords returned no search results. This forced them to manually go through the product categories to search for their desired product.

	<br />
	<br />
	<b>Painpoint #2 – Form fields in the payment contact detail offer no indication on the correct input required from users.
	</b>
	<br />
	Users failed the checkout process since they did not provide their surname in the contact details. A billing surname error was presented but users do not understand what the error is referring to.

</p>

<br />

<h2><i>Task Flow</i></h2>
<p>
	Based on my user observations, I composed a task flow diagram to better visualize where these painpoints are occurring as a user tries to purchase a product. The two painpoints are highlighted in green within the flow.

<br />
<h2>ii. Ideation</h2>
<p>Informed by these findings, I began to sketch out some interfaces for the search and payment form.

</p>

<br />
<h2>iii. Prototyping</h2>
<p>
	After drawing out several ideas, I then filtered them out and chose ideas that integrated best design practices for search and checkout form. I used Sketch to create a high-fidelity mock-up for these interface design.
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>Painpoint #1 - Search functionality is broken with no available means of recovery for users</b>
	<br/>
	<b>Design Solution: </b>Integrating the design from the mother-of-all-searches (i.e. Google search), I proposed an auto-fill search form to help users with their search input.

	<br />
	Even if the search returned no results, I also added search suggestions to encourage users to explore other relevant products available in the shop.

	<br />
	<b>Painpoint #2 - Form fields in the payment contact detail offer no indication on the correct input required from users.</b>
	<br/>
	<b>Design Solution: </b>Incorporating elements from Andrew Coyle’s best practice for online forms, I proposed the following interface...
	<img src="assets/img/work/proj-4/Brook-Checkout.jpg" alt="Brook-search-solution-1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block">
	I eliminated the ambiguous Billing Surname error and specified errors made by users inline - after they have entered the text in the ‘name’ input field. Additionally, users’ input will be validated (via the checkmark or exclamation mark icon) after they have entered their input and exited the form.

<h5>RESULTS</h5>
<h2>Evaluation and Future Considerations</h2>
<p>
	Due to the time frame of this project, I was unable to validate my design via an interactive prototype with users. However, this is a crucial step that I will integrate in my design if I revisit this project.
