<h5>CHALLENGE</h5>
<p>Cognitive Testing on the Computer (C-TOC) is a series of cognitive tests that are administered to seniors in order to capture early signs of cognitive impairments.

	The Pattern Construction task required its users to construct a shape based on the provided "Target Pattern". Scoring for this task is a combination of the following factors:
	<li><b>Accuracy:</b> shapes must be placed within 15 pixels of the correct location</li>
	<li><b>Time:</b> total time it took the user to construct their pattern</li>
	<li><b>Number of moves:</b> total number of actions the user took to construct the pattern</li>

<h5>MY ROLE</h5>
<p>
	I acted as a UX Designer and Developer in this project, where I designed PowerPoint mock-ups to capture initial feedback from my supervisors.
	Afterwards, I developed these mock-ups into high-fidelity prototypes with JavaScript.

<h5>APPROACH</h5>
<h2>i. Establishing Requirements and Ideation</h2>
<p>
	Before implementing the prototype, I created a wireframe mock-up of this task (via PowerPoint) to help gather my requirements. I presented these wireframes to my team, to clarify the layout of the task.

	<br />
	<b>Insight: </b>I realized that these wireframes have also helped me communicate my ideas for how the scoring system would be applied. For example, we concluded to integrate the 15 pixels error window for accuracy, and the amount of points given based on the shape's complexity. My team and I were able to visualize the back-end scoring system through these mock-ups.

<h2>ii. Prototyping</h2>
<p>
	The most challenging part of prototyping this task was to implement the draggable shapes. After much desk research, I decided to use RaphaelJS framework for this feature, due to its ease of implementation and detailed documentations.

<h5>RESULTS</h5>
<h2>Evaluation and Future Considerations</h2>
<p>
	Since C-TOC is currently still in its prototype design and implementation stage, I was not able to evaluate the Pattern Construction task with target users (those who are at risk of early cognitive impairments). Hence, the feedback I have received for my prototype was given by my supervisors and graduate students. However, I recognized the need for user-centric approach and I encouraged my team members to test my prototypes early with appropriate target users for further refinements.
