<h5>SITUATION</h5>
<p>
As part of the Design Practice module in my MSc. course, our group was required to conceptualize
	 an assistive technology for a specified user group with impairments. After consulting the literature, we
	agreed to focus on investigating Braille technologies for the visually impaired.
</p>
<h5><i>What I did:</i></h5>
<p>
	From my own desk research, I proposed the following ideas:
	<img src="assets/img/work/proj-1/InitialResearch/brainstorm_DP.jpg" alt="Brailliac">
	<i>1) An augmented reality smart glasses that help wheelchair users avoid obstacles .</i>
	<br />

	<i>2) A vibrotactile glove that prevents the blind from harming themselves in the kitchen</i>
</p>

<h5>TASK</h5>
<p>
	From our desk research, we found that there were fewer and fewer blind users who adopt Braille technologies; they would use screen readers instead.
	As Braille can benefit blind users' level of literacy, our group decided to focus on exploring an assistive technology that would encourage blind users
	to adopt and utilize Braille.

<h5>ACTION</h5>
<h5>i. Establishing Requirements</h5>
<p>
	We conducted a field observation in the Royal National Institute for the Blind's Sight Village fair (image 2) to help us understand existing
	technologies for the blind, such as Braille keyboards (image 1) and screen readers (image 3). We found several limitations of these devices: they were quite expensive and bulky in size.
	<br />

	<br />

	By following the user-centred approach, we set out to recruit participants and conduct user interviews in order to verify our assumptions
	and findings so far. After conducting 7 interviews (6 phone- and 1-in person), we created affinity diagrams to analyze all of our findings.

	<br />
	<br />
	<h5><i>What I did:</i></h5>
	<p>
		I recruited 6 fully-blind participants and conducted 3 phone interviews to gather more insight on the pros and cons of existing assistive technologies for the blind. Participants commented that many of these technologies are expensive, bulky, and non-discreet.

	</p>

	<h5>ii. Ideation</h5>
	<p>
	We created affinity diagrams to analyze all of our interview findings, grouping them into common themes to help establish our user requirements.
	We found several themes from our analysis, which include:
		<li>Where we find ‘text in the wild’ (e.g. newspaper, restaurant menus, etc)</li>
		<li>Existing assistive technologies for the blind, and their strengths and weaknesses</li>
		<li>Problems with printed text Benefits and limitations of Braille</li>
		<li>Benefits and limitations of assistive speech technology</li>
		<img src="assets/img/work/proj-1/InitialResearch/affinitydiagram.jpg" alt="Brailliac">
	We decided to go with the concept of a device that projects Braille alphabets on the fingertip.
	</p>


	<h5><i>What I did:</i></h5>
		Based on these themes, we did another brainstorming session. I came up with an assistive device that projects Braille on your tongue.

	<br />

	<h5>iii. Prototyping</h5>
	<h5><i>What I did:</i></h5>
	<p>
		<img src="assets/img/work/proj-1/prototyping/storyboard.png" alt="Brailliac">
		I created some storyboards to illustrate how this proof of concept can be used in context. To create a low-fi prototype of this concept,
		I started with some sketches and created my prototypes based on them. I created a low-fidelity prototype with paper and rubber band. I also
		formed a slot to insert strips of Braille sentences and a cut-out window on the prototype so users can detect the Braille letters.
		These Braille strips were cut out from medicine packages.
		<br />

	</p>

	<h5>iv. Evaluation</h5>
	<img src="assets/img/work/proj-1/prototyping/lowfiprotos2.png" alt="Brailliac">
	<p>
		We validated our low-fidelity prototypes with one user. My other group members developed their own prototypes using modelling clay
		and rubber bands to integrate adjustability (e.g. using an stretchable band, see Prototype 4 and 5 in the images above).
	</p>
	<p>
		<h5><i>What I did:</i></h5>
		I carried out my user evaluation as a semi-structured interview, asking my participant specific tasks such as reading the Braille
		strips and inquiring them for suggestions/ feedback throughout the evaluation. In my evaluation (for Prototype 1), the participant positively received my prototype, because of its light-weightedness,
		adjustability on different finger sizes, and flexibility to read Braille with.

<h5>RESULTS</h5>
	<p>
		My colleague, Wojciech Puciłowski, created a final design of Brailliac (see below), which takes into account the feedback we've
		gained from our interviews and evaluation. Our design ensures that the device is versatile (easily carried), adjustable for
		different fingers, and discreet when users are wearing them.

		We also submitted our report and a video of Brailliac to the ACM CHI 2016 (San Jose) Conference.
