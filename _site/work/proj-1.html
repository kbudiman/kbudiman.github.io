<h5>Design Brief</h5>
<p>
As part of the Design Practice module in the MSc. Human-Computer Interaction with Ergonomics course, the design brief required us to develop an assistive technology for a specified user group, whose needs are out of the norm. 
</p>


<h5>Brainstorming</h5>
<p>
	We initially brainstormed and sketched different assistive technology concepts.  I proposed the following ideas:

	<i>1) An augmented reality smart glasses that help wheelchair users avoid obstacles .</i>
	<br />
	<br />

	<i>2) A vibrotactile glove that prevents the blind from harming themselves in the kitchen</i>
</p>


<h5>Field Observations</h5>
<p>
	We visited the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) to attend a Sight Village fair (image 2) that showcased assistive devices for blind users. We also discovered smartphone apps (‘Be My Eyes’ and ‘TapTapSee’) that take pictures of text and output spoken feedback to read the image content. Sight Village showcased a variety of assistive devices for the blind, such as the Braille keyboard (image 1) that connects to laptops and screen readers (image 3) for the visually impaired.

<h5>User Interviews</h5>
<p>
	We had 7 interviews in total (6 phone, 1 in-person), all with fully blind participants. I recruited 6 participants and conducted 3 phone interviews to gather more insight on the pros and cons of existing assistive technologies for the blind. Participants commented that many of these technologies are expensive, bulky, and non-discreet.

<h5>Affinity Diagrams</h5>
<p>

	We created affinity diagrams to analyze all of our findings, grouping them into common themes to help establish our user requirements. We found several themes from our analysis, which include:
		<li>Where we find ‘text in the wild’ (e.g. newspaper, restaurant menus, etc)</li>
		<li>Existing assistive technologies for the blind, and their strengths and weaknesses</li>
		<li>Problems with printed text Benefits and limitations of Braille</li>
		<li>Benefits and limitations of assistive speech technology</li>
	<br />
	Based on these themes, we did another brainstorming session. I came up with an assistive device that projects Braille on your tongue. We decided to go with another idea of a device that projects Braille alphabets on the fingertip.

<h5>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h5>
<p>
	<img src="assets/img/work/proj-1/prototyping/storyboard.png" alt="Brailliac">
	I created some storyboards to illustrate how this proof of concept can be used in context. To create a low-fi prototype of this concept, I started with some sketches and created my prototypes based on them. I created a low-fidelity prototype with paper and rubber band. I also formed a slot to insert strips of Braille sentences and a cut-out window on the prototype so users can detect the Braille letters. These Braille strips were cut out from medicine packages.

<h5>Evaluation and Refinements</h5>

<p>
	We validated our low-fidelity prototypes with one user. He positively received my prototype, because it’s light-weighted, adjustable on different finger sizes, and flexible to read Braille with.
	
	<br />
	We refined our clay model prototypes to integrate adjustability (e.g. using an stretchable band, see Prototype 4 and 5 in the images above). My colleague, Wojciech Puciłowski, created a final design of Brailliac (see below) - based on the comments and suggestions we have received from our evaluation.

<h5>CHI 2016</h5>
<p>
	We submitted our report and a video of Brailliac to the ACM CHI 2016 (San Jose) Conference.
