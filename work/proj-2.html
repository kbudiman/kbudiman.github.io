<h5>Context</h5>
<p>Cognitive Testing on the Computer (C-TOC) is a series of cognitive tests that are administered to seniors in order to capture early signs of cognitive impairments. I was asked to implement initial prototypes for these tests and making sure that they are compatible with tablets and desktop. 
</p>

<h5>Brief</h5>
<p>
	The Arithmetic task required its users to answer a math equation, in order to assess their arithmetic cognitive abilities. Scoring for this task is a combination of the following factors:
	<li><b>Correctness:</b> whether the equation was answered correctly</li>
	<li><b>Time:</b> total time it took the user to complete the equation</li>
</p>

<h5>Gathering Requirements</h5>
<p>
	I implemented wireframes for this task by using Balsamiq. This tool has helped me to communicate my interpretation of the layout and flow of the task.

	As shown in the image below, it has helped me determine which dialogue box to display (and the content in the dialogue box) when the user incorrectly answered an equation.

<h5>Prototype Implementation</h5>
<p>
	After gathering feedback from my supervisors in our bi-weekly meetings, I implemented these wireframes by using JavaScript. One of the challenges of this implementation was to make sure that responsive design was included, since users could have used their desktop or tablet to complete the arithmetic task.

	I also used PHP to generate a .txt file at the end of the test, which recorded the overall score and performance of the user.
</p>

<h5>Evaluation and Future Considerations</h5>
<p>
	Since C-TOC is currently still in its prototype design and implementation stage, I was not able to evaluate the Arithmetic task with target users (those who are at risk of early cognitive impairments). Hence, the feedback I have received for my prototype was given by my supervisors and graduate students. However, I recognized the need for user-centric approach and I encouraged my team members to test my prototypes early with appropriate target users for further refinements.
