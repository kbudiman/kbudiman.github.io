<h5>Brief</h5>
<p>
	As part of our Design Experience module in the MSc. HCI-E course, we were given the task to design a terminal workstation for a recreational centre. After considering ergonomic and user experience factors, we were asked to present our design and recommendations to the client (role-played by our instructors). The client would then decide whether the group would "win" the design pitch.
</p>

<h5>Defining the Target Population</h5>
<p>
	In attempting to define who our target population is, my team members and I individually visited our local leisure centres to conduct <b>contextual inquiries</b>. We quickly realized that we need consistency in our inquiries, since each centre attracted a diverse set of users (depending on their facilities and the time of day visitors visit).

<h5>Task Analyses</h5>
<p>
	Hence, we decided to split off into smaller groups to conduct task analyses methods we learned from our ergonomic module. I carried out an analyses of the centre's <b>environment</b> to identify possible locations for our proposed kiosk. I have also recorded the staff's <b>workload</b> at every two minutes to see when queues start to build up, which causes work overload. Some of my group members applied the <a href="http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/71907/">Hexagon-Spindle Model</a> in order to gain a hollistic view for our design. The model allowed us to not only consider the workstation design, but also the environmental layout and business perspectives.

	By combining the findings from our task analyses and contextual inquiries, we then continue to establish our user requirements, emphasizing who our limiting users consist of.

<h5>Workspace Design</h5>
<p>
	Our team split off again into two groups. One subgroup worked on applying Human-Machine Interface guidelines for our interface. I assisted the other group to work on workspace design. I initially calculated some <b>graphical anthropometric</b> measures, based on our defined user demographics.

	<br />
	We then validated these calculations through <b>fitting trials</b>. We conducted them with members of our class to calculate the optimal height for our screen display.

<h5>Mock-ups Design and Evaluation</h5>
<p>
	We constructed <b>low-fidelity mockups</b> for our kiosk design and evaluated them through several <b>user testing</b> sessions. Through the <b>Rapid Entire Body Assessment</b> and <b>Rapid Upper Limb Assessment</b>, we quickly realized that our initial design (the left kiosk) posed severe risks for upper limbs and postural disorders amongst wheelchair users. We then reconstructed our kiosk mockups to prevent body twisting and prolonged reach for these users. This is displayed in the picture below, with the hollow bottom of the right kiosk.

	After conducting 3 iterations of user testing for both the interface flow and workspace design, we then finalized our design concept and prepared for our client presentation. 
</p>

<h5>Deliverables</h5>
<p>
	We won the design pitch from our client and our group earned the highest distinction mark in this module. Our full presentation slides can be viewed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4u01jLTgZD0QkRXRWJ1YVBTS1U/view?usp=sharing">here</a> (graphics are rendered by Liza Jego Mendoza).
