<h5>CHALLENGE</h5>
<p>
	With the large amount of data for how different local services were performing, the Lambeth City Council (LCC) wanted to identify a way for
	their staff to analyze and comprehend trends in these data.
<br />
	<img src="assets/img/work/proj-8/de2-7.jpg" alt="DE2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block">
	The LCC assigned our group with the task to design an analytics tool to understand how different local services are performing.
	One of the challenges in this project is to design a tool that caters towards staff who don't have previous training in data visualizations and analytics. Another challenge was the time constraint:
	our group was assigned two weeks to conduct the user research, interface design, and further recommendations.

<h5>MY ROLE</h5>
<p>
	I acted as the primary user researcher and interaction designer in this project. I recruited participants, moderated user interviews, and led the prototype evaluation.
	I created an interactive mock-up with Axure RP to compare different correlations in the interface.

<h5>APPROACH</h5>
<h2>i. Establishing Requirements</h2>
<p>
	To understand the current work practices of the LCC, our group decided to setup initial interviews with the staff. However, we encountered difficulties
	as the busy schedule of the staff prevented us from meeting them in person. To counter this challenge, I decided to <b>deploy SurveyMonkey's online survey</b>
	in order to collect initial feedback about existing LCC analytics tools, current work practices, and pros/cons for each tool.

	<p style="text-align: center"><i>A screenshot of a SurveyMonkey question</i></p>

<br />
	<b>Insight: </b>The findings of the online survey gave me further insight into the requirements of the project brief. In one of the requirements, staff
	wanted to <i>ask questions of data</i>, and I found that this meant comparing their data with other data set to analyze how their local service is performing.

</p>



<h2>ii. Ideation</h2>
<p>	I learned that one of the most prominent tool utilized by the staff was Google Analytics. Informed by this finding, I <b>sketched an interface </b>
	for the analytics tool in the form of a dashboard. I chose this interface since it was the design that staff were most familiar with.

	I also sketched how the interface might compare different data sets and correlations. I designed the tool to comparing two data sets
	side-by-side and highlighting the trends that were relevant.
</p>

<br />
<h2>iii. Prototyping</h2>
<p>
	From these sketch, I decided to create an <b>interactive wireframe using Axure RP</b> to collect feedback from users about the layout and interaction of this comparison feature.

</p>

<h2>iv. Evaluation</h2>
<p>
	I <b>evaluated my prototype</b> with a commissioner and a data analyst. When interacting with the Axure prototype, the commissioner stated
	that he wanted to see clearer explanations of how the suggested correlations relate with his data. He proposed adding clearer titles and short explanation to describe relationship
	between data sets. The prototype was then modified to provide text description of how correlations relate to each other.

	<p style="text-align: center"><i>Text description for suggested correlations (prototype courtesy of Elise Hein)</i></p>

	<b>Insight (Service Design): </b>After analyzing our interviews and evaluations, we have found that the LCC also employed data analysts. It became clearer that the primary reason behind this
	analytics tool was to reduce the number of ad-hoc requests analysts received from commissioners. These analysts must retrieve data from various sources, such as the web or other internal departments, to create
	customized data reports for staff. This practice leads to inconsistent data formatting and inefficient work structure.

	<br />
	<br />
	In order to understand the organizational patterns in LCC, I <b>led a workshop for my group on applying a sociotechnical framework</b>, Checkland's "Soft System Methodology" (SSM). With this framework, I mapped out the
	relationships between work roles and demands to identify any workplace conflicts.

<h5>RESULTS</h5>

<p>
	We incorporated the feedback from our prototype evaluation into our final interface design. Additionally, through mapping the workplace relationships with SSM, my group also recommended
	a centralized database to address the fragmented data formatting. We also proposed an on-boarding program that helps commissioners to become comfortable
	with the proposed tool and feel empowered to do their own analyses. Our full presentation can be found by clicking the image below.
