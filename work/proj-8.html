<h5>SITUATION</h5>
<p>
	With the sizeable amount of data for how different local services were performing, the Lambeth City Council (LCC) wanted to identify a way for
	their staff to analyze and comprehend trends in these data.
</p>

<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #ccc">
<h5>TASK</h5>
<p>
The LCC assigned our group with the task to design an analytics tool to help their commissioners understand how different council services are performing.
In this course module, our group comprised of 7 team members (including myself). One of the challenges in this project is to design a tool
that caters towards staff who don't have previous training in data visualizations and analytics. Another challenge was the time constraint:
	our group was assigned two weeks to conduct the user research, interface design, and further recommendations.

<h5>ACTION</h5>
<h5>1. Establishing Requirements</h5>
From our project brief and desk research, we were given several requirements for our tool's design. Before progressing further,
we adhere to the user-centred approach by validating these assumptions and requirements with the potential users of the system.
Once we validated them, we separated them into functional and non-functional requirements.

<p>
	<h5><i>What I did:</i></h5>
	After encountering difficulties trying to setup initial interviews with commissioners, I decided to use <b>SurveyMonkey's online survey</b>
	in order to collect initial feedback about existing analytics tools the staff used, current work practices, and pros/cons for each tool.
	<br />
	One of the requirements that we have found from these survey was that commissioners would like to 'ask questions of data', by
	receiving suggestions of other data sets that may be relevant and helpful for their own outcomes. These suggestions may be automatically generated by the system or by other staff.

</p>


<h5>2. Ideation</h5>
<h5><i>What I did:</i></h5>
	I learned that one of the most prominent tool utilized by the commissioner was Google Analytics. Informed by this finding, I <b>sketched</b>
	out a possible interface for the analytics tool, in the form of a dashboard. I chose this interface since it was the design that
	commissioners were most familiar with.

	<p>
	I also decided to sketch how the interface might fulfill the requirement for how the system might suggest other possible data. I
	envisioned the tool comparing the two data sets, side by side and highlighting the trends that were relevant.
	</p>


<h5>3. Prototyping</h5>
<i><h5>What I did:</h5></i>
<p>
	By taking my initial sketch into account, I decided to create an <b>interactive wireframe using Axure RP</b> for further exploration and
	evaluation with the user, to elicit and collect feedback about the layout and interaction of this comparison feature.

</p>

<h5>4. Evaluation</h5>
<p>
	We evaluated our prototype with a commissioner and a data analyst. When interacting with the Axure prototype, the commissioner stated
	that he wanted to see clearer explanations of how the suggested correlations relate with his data. He proposed adding clearer titles and short explanation to describe relationship
	between correlations. We then modified our prototype to provide text description to show correlations that experienced the same trends.

<h5>RESULTS</h5>
<p>
<h5>Service Design</h5>
After analyzing our interviews and evaluations, we have found that the LCC also employed data analysts. It became clearer that the primary reason behind the design of this
analytics tool was to reduce the number of ad-hoc requests that analysts received from commissioners - to create different personalized reports. These analysts must retrieve data from various sources, such as the web or other internal departments.
This practice leads to inconsistent data organization and formatting.

	<p style="text-align: center"><i>Analyses of organizational structure, relationships, and stakeholders</i></p>
<p>
	Along with the proposed tool design, our group also recommended a centralized database to address the fragmented data.
Feedback gained and frequent use from commissioners will enable the database to become more intelligent and customizable for
commissioners to conduct their own analyses. We also recommended an on-boarding program that helps commissioners to become comfortable
	with the proposed tool and feel empowered to do their own analyses.
</p>

<i><h5>What I did:</h5></i>
<p>
	In order to better understand the organizational patterns in LCC, I applied the Checkland's <b>Soft System Methodology</b> (SSM) to map out the
	relationships between work roles and demands. I taught my group members the procedures for SSM to help us identify any conflicts
	within the workplace.
