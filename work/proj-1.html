</p>

<h5>CHALLENGE</h5>
<p>
	Working in a group of five, I was required to conceptualize an assistive technology for a specific user group with impairments.

	To generate some initial concepts from my own desk research, <b>I brainstormed and sketched</b> the following ideas:

	<i>1) An augmented reality smart glasses that help wheelchair users avoid obstacles .</i>
	<br />

	<i>2) A vibrotactile glove that prevents the blind from harming themselves in the kitchen</i>
</p>

<h5>MY ROLE</h5>
<p>
	I acted as a user researcher and prototyper in this project. I was responsible for user recruitment and running user interview sessions. I
	also developed a low-fidelity prototype to evaluate our design concept.

<h5>APPROACH</h5>
<h2>i. Establishing Requirements</h2>
	<p> After consulting the literature, we agreed to focus on investigating Braille technologies as it can benefit blind users' literacy level.
	We conducted a field observation at the Royal National Institute for the Blind's Sight Village fair (image 2) to help us learn about existing
	technologies for the blind, such as Braille keyboards (image 1) and screen readers (image 3). We found several limitations of these devices: they were expensive and bulky in size.
	<br />

	<br />

	By following the user-centered approach, <b>I recruited 6 fully-blind participants and conducted 3 phone interviews</b> to gather more
		insight on the pros and cons of existing assistive technologies. Participants commented that many of these technologies
		are expensive, bulky, and non-discreet to use.

	</p>

<h2>ii. Ideation</h2>
	<p>
	The interview findings were then grouped into common themes to help establish our user requirements.
	Several themes that arose from our analysis include:
		<li>Where we find ‘text in the wild’ (e.g. newspaper, restaurant menus, etc)</li>
		<li>Existing blind assistive technologies' strengths and weaknesses</li>
		<li>Problems with printed text</li>
		<li>Benefits and limitations of Braille</li>
		<li>Benefits and limitations of assistive speech technology</li>
		<img src="assets/img/work/proj-1/InitialResearch/affinitydiagram.jpg" alt="Brailliac">

	Based on these themes, <b>I sketched and proposed</b> an assistive device that projects Braille on your tongue. However, our group decided
	that a device that sits on the user's finger would have more dexterity and convenience with its use.

<h2>iii. Prototyping</h2>
	<p>
		<img src="assets/img/work/proj-1/prototyping/storyboard.png" alt="Brailliac">
		I created some <b>sketches and storyboards</b> to illustrate the context where this device can be used. Then, I <b>constructed a low-fi prototype</b> of this concept,
		with paper and rubber band. I cut out a slot to insert strips of Braille sentences and a small window on the prototype where users can detect the Braille letters.
		These Braille strips were cut out from medicine packages.
		<br />

	</p>


<h2>iv. Evaluation</h2>
	<img src="assets/img/work/proj-1/prototyping/lowfiprotos2.png" alt="Brailliac">
	<p>
		We validated our low-fidelity prototypes with one user. My other group members developed their own prototypes using modelling clay
		and rubber bands to integrate adjustability (e.g. using an stretchable band, see Prototype 4 and 5 in the images above). I carried out my
		user evaluation in a <b>semi-structured interview</b>, asking my participant specific tasks such as reading the Braille
		strips and inquiring them for suggestions/ feedback throughout the evaluation. In my evaluation (for Prototype 1), the participant positively received my prototype, because of its light-weightedness,
		adjustability on different finger sizes, and flexibility to read Braille with.

<h5>RESULTS</h5>
	<p>
		My colleague, Wojciech Puciłowski, created a final design of Brailliac (see below), which takes into account the feedback we've
		gained from our interviews and evaluation. Our design ensures that the device is versatile (easily carried), adjustable for
		different fingers, and discreet when users are wearing them.

		A report and a how-it-works video of Brailliac were submitted to the ACM CHI 2016 (San Jose) Conference.
